## Reflection:

### Learnings:
- *Data Selection*: Understanding the datasets and determining common attributes for joining is crucial. In our case, the 'Country' column served as a common key.
- *Data Extraction*: Ensuring data integrity while loading into the database is essential. This often involves handling missing values, data type mismatches, and other inconsistencies.
- *Data Transformation*: Aggregation and JOIN operations can provide valuable insights. In this case, understanding happiness scores at a regional level and joining with external factors (like tourism) can provide a richer analysis.

### Challenges:
- Dealing with inconsistencies and missing data: We had to ensure that the data from different years was consistent and that any missing values were addressed.
- Joining datasets: Creating a dummy dataset that makes sense in the context of the primary dataset was challenging. The dummy data had to be relevant and meaningful for any subsequent analyses.

### Next Steps:
- Explore further analyses using the transformed dataset, such as identifying correlations between tourism scores and happiness scores.
- Incorporate more real-world datasets to enrich the analysis, rather than relying on dummy data.
