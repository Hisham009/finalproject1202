## Reflection:

### Learnings:
- *Data Selection*: Understanding the datasets and determining common attributes for joining is crucial. In our case, the 'Country' column served as a common key.
- *Data Extraction*: Ensuring data integrity while loading into the database is essential. This often involves handling missing values, data type mismatches, and other inconsistencies.
- *Data Transformation*: Aggregation and JOIN operations can provide valuable insights. In this case, understanding happiness scores at a regional level and joining with external factors (like tourism) can provide a richer analysis.

### Challenges:
- Dealing with inconsistencies and missing data: We had to ensure that the data from different years was consistent and that any missing values were addressed.
- Joining datasets: Creating a dummy dataset that makes sense in the context of the primary dataset was challenging. The dummy data had to be relevant and meaningful for any subsequent analyses.

### Next Steps:
- Explore further analyses using the transformed dataset, such as identifying correlations between tourism scores and happiness scores.
- Incorporate more real-world datasets to enrich the analysis, rather than relying on dummy data.

#Explanation
#The provided reflection content summarizes the key things learned and challenges faced during a data analysis project. It emphasizes the importance of selecting relevant data and using common attributes to connect different datasets, ensuring accurate data extraction and handling inconsistencies. The reflection also highlights the value of transforming data through techniques like aggregation and joining, which can provide more meaningful insights. Challenges mentioned include dealing with inconsistencies and creating appropriate dummy data for analysis. The reflection concludes by suggesting future steps, such as exploring relationships between variables and using real-world data for more comprehensive analyses.
