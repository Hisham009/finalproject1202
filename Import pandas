import os
import pandas as pd

primary_data_2015 = pd.read_csv(os.path.join( '/content/2015.csv'))

# Displaying the first few rows of the 2015 dataset
print(primary_data_2015.head())

#Explaination
#It first imports two tools: os and pandas. os helps with working with files and directories, while pandas is used for handling and analyzing data.

#The code then uses the pd.read_csv() function to read the content of a CSV file named "2015.csv" located in a specific directory. This function loads the data into a special kind of table called a Data Frame.
