## Reflection:

### Learnings:
- *Data Selection*: Understanding the datasets and determining common attributes for joining is crucial. In our case, the 'Country' column served as a common key.
- *Data Extraction*: Ensuring data integrity while loading into the database is essential. This often involves handling missing values, data type mismatches, and other inconsistencies.
- *Data Transformation*: Aggregation and JOIN operations can provide valuable insights. In this case, understanding happiness scores at a regional level and joining with external factors (like tourism) can provide a richer analysis.

### Challenges:
- Dealing with inconsistencies and missing data: We had to ensure that the data from different years was consistent and that any missing values were addressed.
- Joining datasets: Creating a dummy dataset that makes sense in the context of the primary dataset was challenging. The dummy data had to be relevant and meaningful for any subsequent analyses.

### Next Steps:
- Explore further analyses using the transformed dataset, such as identifying correlations between tourism scores and happiness scores.
- Incorporate more real-world datasets to enrich the analysis, rather than relying on dummy data.

# Writing the reflection content to the README.md file
with open('README.md', 'w') as readme_file:
    readme_file.write(reflection_content)

print("README.md file created successfully.")

#explanation
#This piece of code does two main things:

#It takes the reflection content you provided and saves it as a variable called reflection_content.

#Then, it creates a file named "README.md" (a common file for project documentation) and writes the reflection_content into that file.

#After this code is executed, you'll have a "README.md" file in your project folder with the reflection content you wrote. This file will be formatted in a way that's easy to read and understand, suitable for sharing insights and reflections about your project. The code ends by printing a message confirming that the README file has been created successfully.
